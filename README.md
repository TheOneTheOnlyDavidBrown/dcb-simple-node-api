# dcb-simple-node-api

Simple node api designed to spin up for frontend testing when the backend doesn't have the data/endpoint yet. It allows a front end developer to quickly add an endpoint with mock data so there is minimal transition when a real endpoint is added.

###Installation

* `bower install dcb-simple-node-api`
* Run `npm install`
* Run `nodemon server.js`


The default path will be http://localhost:8080/api/

The port can be configured in the .env file
