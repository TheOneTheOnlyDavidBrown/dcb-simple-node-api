# dcb-simple-node-api

Simple node api designed to spin up for frontend testing when the backend doesn't have the data/endpoint yet. It allows a front end developer to quickly add an endpoint with mock data so there is minimal transition when a real endpoint is added.

##Installation
```
-Pull down code
-Run `npm install`
-Run `node server.js`
```

The default path will be http://localhost:8080/api/

The port can be configured in the .env file
